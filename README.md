## Deep Convoluted General Adversarial Networks 

An interactive implementation of a Deep Convoluted Generative Adversarial Network to
make the deep model generate its own version of the image and made a GIF to look at the 
evolution of the image from random noise to a proper image from the dataset. MNIST
Dataset was used
